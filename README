# Hello Team!

## Getting started by adding a readme we can use to describe the project, code and emulation environment.

### Some dog puns.

> Anything is paw-sible when you have a dog.
> That dog fur-ocious!
> That floor was ruff.
> Quit hounding me.
> I like big mutts and I cannot lie.
> Thanks fur everything!
> He’s not fat. He’s just a little husky.
> Make sure you have a pup tent.
> Ruff-housing.
> That dog is barking up the wrong pedigree.
> What do you call a dog magician? A Labracadabrador.
